# Saral-Requests-API

SARAL is the eLearning platform of NavGurukul, which is available on website http://saral.navgurukul.org. I have created a CLI based app where users can access the content of saral using the terminal.

Here I implemented a basic version of an eLearning API, using express framework of Node JS. The users can manage and create different courses, exercises and also manage submissions, using basic CRUD operations.

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

To install express, run the following command on your terminal in Linux.

```
sudo apt-get install npm
npm install express --save
```
To run your code, first open your server port using `node file_name.js` in your working directory in terminal. And, then you can apply the basic CRUD operations.
